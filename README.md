# What Is PassPro
* PassPro was initially created because of a request that was made by a fellow student in my class in 2020. It is a Windows Desktop Application that is for storing passwords made with C# using Virtual Studio.
Note: (storing passwords in it is not recommended due to the lack of security in one of the script files)
