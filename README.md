# What Is PassPro
* PassPro was initially created because of a request that was made by a fellow student in my class in 2020. It is a Windows Desktop Application that is for storing passwords made with Virtual Studio using C#. This project is also where I learned the syntax structure of the C# programming language

**Important Note:** Storing your passwords in it is not recommended due to the lack of security in one of the script files
